# Udemy_raycasting
Rasycasting in JS and C, based on the "Raycasting Game Development with JavaScript SDL & C" course, from Udemy.

The implentation in C is made for my own purposes, so it's not as the course demands it to be.
This course is no longer available on Udemy to be bought, so it was not my intention to deliver the final project just as they required it to be done.

I used this course to understand the Mathematics concepts of Raycasting and it's basic implementation in a simple game.

This knowledge will be used in the [Cub3D](https://github.com/ferfahl/42SP_cub3d) project later on.
